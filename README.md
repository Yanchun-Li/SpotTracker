# SpotTracker

SpotTracker is a project that uses image recognition technology to detect and track the brightest spot on a person's arm. The goal of this project is to identify the brightest point on the arm using image processing algorithms and track its movement. The system then feeds the calculated position information back to a laser device to adjust its horizontal rotation angle and vertical tilt in real-time, ensuring the laser is always aligned with the tracked point.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to identify and detect the brightest spot on the arm.
- **Motion Tracking**: Tracks the movement trajectory of the bright spot in real-time.
- **Feedback Control**: Adjusts the laser device's rotation angle and tilt based on the position of the bright spot to ensure precise alignment.
